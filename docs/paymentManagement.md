Service Design Specification
fintrack-paymentmanagement-service documentation Version: 1.0.1

Scope
This document provides a structured architectural overview of the paymentManagement microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

Service architects can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
Developers and maintainers will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
Stakeholders and reviewers can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.
Note for Frontend Developers: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the Service API Documentation for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

Note for Backend Developers: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.

PaymentManagement Service Settings Edit
Handles recording and lifecycle management of payments for invoices or as general/unallocated entries. Ensures invoice payment state is synchronized after each payment operation, supports strict business (tenant) isolation, and underpins core financial workflows in FinTrack.

Service Overview
This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port 3004, serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

API Test Interface (API Face): /
Swagger Documentation: /swagger
Postman Collection Download: /getPostmanCollection
Health Checks: /health and /admin/health
Current Session Info: /currentuser
Favicon: /favicon.ico
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-paymentmanagement-service.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

Preview: https://fintrack.prw.mindbricks.com/paymentmanagement-api
Staging: https://fintrack-stage.mindbricks.co/paymentmanagement-api
Production: https://fintrack.mindbricks.co/paymentmanagement-api
Authentication & Security
Login Required: Yes
This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity. If a crud route also is configured to require login, it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

Service Data Objects
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-paymentmanagement-service.

Data deletion is managed using a soft delete strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the isActive field to false.

Object Name	Description	Public Access	Tenant Level
payment	Represents any payment (linked to an invoice or general/unallocated) made or received by the business. Tracks linkage, amount, method, payer, and reference. Tenant-isolated. Triggers invoice status recalculation on changes.	accessProtected	Yes
payment Data Object
Object Overview
Description: Represents any payment (linked to an invoice or general/unallocated) made or received by the business. Tracks linkage, amount, method, payer, and reference. Tenant-isolated. Triggers invoice status recalculation on changes.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. It is defined using the ObjectSettings pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

Core Configuration
Soft Delete: Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (isActive = false) instead of being physically deleted.
Public Access: accessProtected — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.
Tenant-Level Scope: Yes — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.
Properties Schema
Property	Type	Required	Description
amount	Double	Yes	The amount of the payment, in invoice or business operating currency. Must be positive and required.
currency	String	Yes	ISO currency code (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR') used for this payment. Must match business or invoice. Required.
date	Date	Yes	Date the payment was recorded. Used for reporting, filtering, and cash flow tracking. Required.
invoiceId	ID	No	Reference to the associated invoice (if payment is linked); null for general/unallocated payment.
method	String	No	Payment method (e.g., bank transfer, cash, card, cheque, online, etc). Free text; used for reporting/reconciliation. Optional.
notes	Text	No	Internal comments (operator notes, clarifications, etc.). Optional.
payerName	String	No	Name of the payer or payee (customer, vendor, or other party). Useful for general/unlinked payments. Optional, for tracking.
reference	String	No	Payment reference or transaction ID (for reconciliation with bank/etc). Optional.
businessId	ID	Yes	An ID value to represent the tenant id of the business
Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.
Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body. Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

amount: 0.0
currency: 'default'
date: new Date()
businessId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Constant Properties
businessId

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle. A property is set to be constant if the Allow Update option is set to false.

Auto Update Properties
amount currency date invoiceId method notes payerName reference

An update crud API created with the option Auto Params enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the Allow Auto Update option to false. These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

Elastic Search Indexing
amount currency date invoiceId method payerName reference businessId

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.

Database Indexing
date invoiceId businessId

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval. Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.

Cache Select Properties
date

Cache select properties are used to collect data from Redis entity cache with a different key than the data object id. This allows you to cache data that is not directly related to the data object id, but a frequently used filter.

Secondary Key Properties
invoiceId businessId

Secondary key properties are used to create an additional indexed identifiers for the data object, allowing for alternative access patterns. Different than normal indexed properties, secondary keys will act as primary keys and Mindbricks will provide automatic secondary key db utility functions to access the data object by the secondary key.

Relation Properties
invoiceId

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together. You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database. For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes. Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

invoiceId: ID Relation to invoice.id
The target object is a parent object, meaning that the relation is a one-to-many relationship from target to this object.

On Delete: Set Null Required: No

Filter Properties
amount currency date invoiceId method reference businessId

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria. These properties are automatically mapped as API parameters in the listing API's that have "Auto Params" enabled.

amount: Double has a filter named amount

currency: String has a filter named currency

date: Date has a filter named date

invoiceId: ID has a filter named invoiceId

method: String has a filter named method

reference: String has a filter named reference

businessId: ID has a filter named businessId
