Service Design Specification
fintrack-customermanagement-service documentation Version: 1.0.1

Scope
This document provides a structured architectural overview of the customerManagement microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

Service architects can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
Developers and maintainers will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
Stakeholders and reviewers can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.
Note for Frontend Developers: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the Service API Documentation for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

Note for Backend Developers: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.

CustomerManagement Service Settings Edit
Handles all business-specific customer CRUD operations and exposes customer data for sales invoice and reporting workflows. Ensures strict tenant (business) isolation for all customer records and supports role-based access control per business context.

Service Overview
This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port 3001, serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

API Test Interface (API Face): /
Swagger Documentation: /swagger
Postman Collection Download: /getPostmanCollection
Health Checks: /health and /admin/health
Current Session Info: /currentuser
Favicon: /favicon.ico
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-customermanagement-service.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

Preview: https://fintrack.prw.mindbricks.com/customermanagement-api
Staging: https://fintrack-stage.mindbricks.co/customermanagement-api
Production: https://fintrack.mindbricks.co/customermanagement-api
Authentication & Security
Login Required: Yes
This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity. If a crud route also is configured to require login, it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

Service Data Objects
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-customermanagement-service.

Data deletion is managed using a soft delete strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the isActive field to false.

Object Name	Description	Public Access	Tenant Level
customer	Business customer/contact record, uniquely scoped to business. Contains info required for sales, invoicing, and reporting. Not shared across tenants.	accessProtected	Yes
customer Data Object
Object Overview
Description: Business customer/contact record, uniquely scoped to business. Contains info required for sales, invoicing, and reporting. Not shared across tenants.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. It is defined using the ObjectSettings pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

Core Configuration
Soft Delete: Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (isActive = false) instead of being physically deleted.
Public Access: accessProtected — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.
Tenant-Level Scope: Yes — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.
Properties Schema
Property	Type	Required	Description
address	Text	No	Full postal address, optional, multi-line, Unicode supported.
contactEmail	String	No	Primary contact's email address (optional, for notifications or info).
contactName	String	No	Primary contact person's name (optional, for individual or company).
name	String	Yes	Full customer display name (required).
notes	Text	No	Internal notes/comments about the customer, never public.
phone	String	No	Main phone number for contact (optional).
taxNumber	String	No	Tax/VAT identification number or code (optional).
businessId	ID	Yes	An ID value to represent the tenant id of the business
Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.
Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body. Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

name: 'default'
businessId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Constant Properties
businessId

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle. A property is set to be constant if the Allow Update option is set to false.

Auto Update Properties
address contactEmail contactName name notes phone taxNumber

An update crud API created with the option Auto Params enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the Allow Auto Update option to false. These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

Elastic Search Indexing
address contactEmail contactName name phone taxNumber businessId

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.

Database Indexing
name taxNumber businessId

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval. Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.

Secondary Key Properties
businessId

Secondary key properties are used to create an additional indexed identifiers for the data object, allowing for alternative access patterns. Different than normal indexed properties, secondary keys will act as primary keys and Mindbricks will provide automatic secondary key db utility functions to access the data object by the secondary key.

Filter Properties
contactEmail contactName name phone taxNumber businessId

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria. These properties are automatically mapped as API parameters in the listing API's that have "Auto Params" enabled.

contactEmail: String has a filter named contactEmail

contactName: String has a filter named contactName

name: String has a filter named name

phone: String has a filter named phone

taxNumber: String has a filter named taxNumber

businessId: ID has a filter named businessId

Business Logic
customerManagement has got 6 Business APIs to manage its internal and crud logic. For the details of each business API refer to its chapter.
