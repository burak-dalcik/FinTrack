Service Design Specification
fintrack-invoicemanagement-service documentation Version: 1.0.1

Scope
This document provides a structured architectural overview of the invoiceManagement microservice, detailing its configuration, data model, authorization logic, business rules, and API design. It has been automatically generated based on the service definition within Mindbricks, ensuring that the information reflects the source of truth used during code generation and deployment.

The document is intended to serve multiple audiences:

Service architects can use it to validate design decisions and ensure alignment with broader architectural goals.
Developers and maintainers will find it useful for understanding the structure and behavior of the service, facilitating easier debugging, feature extension, and integration with other systems.
Stakeholders and reviewers can use it to gain a clear understanding of the service's capabilities and domain logic.
Note for Frontend Developers: While this document is valuable for understanding business logic and data interactions, please refer to the Service API Documentation for endpoint-level specifications and integration details.

Note for Backend Developers: Since the code for this service is automatically generated by Mindbricks, you typically won't need to implement or modify it manually. However, this document is especially valuable when you're building other services—whether within Mindbricks or externally—that need to interact with or depend on this service. It provides a clear reference to the service's data contracts, business rules, and API structure, helping ensure compatibility and correct integration.

InvoiceManagement Service Settings Edit
Handles creation and modification of all sales (outgoing) and purchase (incoming) invoices for FinTrack SMBs. Supports multi-item entry per invoice, VAT at item level, detailed filtering, and status calculation based on payments and due dates. Strictly scoped to a single business context.

Service Overview
This service is configured to listen for HTTP requests on port 3001, serving both the main API interface and default administrative endpoints.

The following routes are available by default:

API Test Interface (API Face): /
Swagger Documentation: /swagger
Postman Collection Download: /getPostmanCollection
Health Checks: /health and /admin/health
Current Session Info: /currentuser
Favicon: /favicon.ico
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-invoicemanagement-service.

This service is accessible via the following environment-specific URLs:

Preview: https://fintrack.prw.mindbricks.com/invoicemanagement-api
Staging: https://fintrack-stage.mindbricks.co/invoicemanagement-api
Production: https://fintrack.mindbricks.co/invoicemanagement-api
Authentication & Security
Login Required: Yes
This service requires user authentication for access. It supports both JWT and RSA-based authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure user sessions and data integrity. If a crud route also is configured to require login, it will check a valid JWT token in the request query/header/bearer/cookie. If the token is valid, it will extract the user information from the token and make the fetched session data available in the request context.

Service Data Objects
The service uses a PostgreSQL database for data storage, with the database name set to fintrack-invoicemanagement-service.

Data deletion is managed using a soft delete strategy. Instead of removing records from the database, they are flagged as inactive by setting the isActive field to false.

Object Name	Description	Public Access	Tenant Level
invoice	Represents a single sales or purchase invoice document for a business. Contains summary information, partner (customer/supplier), and status derived from payments and dates.	accessPrivate	Yes
invoiceItem	Represents a single line item in an invoice, with product/service linkage, quantity, pricing, VAT, and per-line total.	accessPrivate	Yes
invoice Data Object
Object Overview
Description: Represents a single sales or purchase invoice document for a business. Contains summary information, partner (customer/supplier), and status derived from payments and dates.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. It is defined using the ObjectSettings pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

Core Configuration
Soft Delete: Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (isActive = false) instead of being physically deleted.
Public Access: accessPrivate — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.
Tenant-Level Scope: Yes — Enables data isolation per tenant by attaching a tenant ID field.
Composite Indexes
businessInvoiceNumberUnique: [businessId, invoiceNumber] This composite index is defined to optimize query performance for complex queries involving multiple fields.
The index also defines a conflict resolution strategy for duplicate key violations.

When a new record would violate this composite index, the following action will be taken:

On Duplicate: throwError

An error will be thrown, preventing the insertion of conflicting data.

Properties Schema
Property	Type	Required	Description
currency	String	Yes	Currency code for all values in invoice and its items (e.g., 'USD').
customerId	ID	No	Referenced customer (for sales invoice; null for purchase invoice).
dueDate	Date	Yes	Date by which payment for this invoice is due.
invoiceNumber	String	Yes	A unique identifier (number/code) for this invoice within a business.
issueDate	Date	Yes	Date this invoice was issued.
notes	Text	No	Internal notes about the invoice, never publicly exposed.
status	Enum	Yes	Derived status of invoice: unpaid/partial/paid/overdue, based on payment records and dueDate.
supplierId	ID	No	Referenced supplier (for purchase invoice; null for sales invoice).
totalAmount	Double	Yes	Grand total for invoice (sum of line item totals, including VAT). Calculated; always up-to-date.
type	Enum	Yes	Invoice nature; 'sales'=outgoing, 'purchase'=incoming.
businessId	ID	Yes	An ID value to represent the tenant id of the business
Required properties are mandatory for creating objects and must be provided in the request body if no default value is set.
Default Values
Default values are automatically assigned to properties when a new object is created, if no value is provided in the request body. Since default values are applied on db level, they should be literal values, not expressions.If you want to use expressions, you can use transposed parameters in any business API to set default values dynamically.

currency: 'default'
dueDate: new Date()
invoiceNumber: 'default'
issueDate: new Date()
status: unpaid
totalAmount: 0.0
type: "sales"
businessId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Constant Properties
status totalAmount type businessId

Constant properties are defined to be immutable after creation, meaning they cannot be updated or changed once set. They are typically used for properties that should remain constant throughout the object's lifecycle. A property is set to be constant if the Allow Update option is set to false.

Auto Update Properties
currency customerId dueDate invoiceNumber issueDate notes status supplierId type

An update crud API created with the option Auto Params enabled will automatically update these properties with the provided values in the request body. If you want to update any property in your own business logic not by user input, you can set the Allow Auto Update option to false. These properties will be added to the update API's body parameters and can be updated by the user if any value is provided in the request body.

Enum Properties
Enum properties are defined with a set of allowed values, ensuring that only valid options can be assigned to them. The enum options value will be stored as strings in the database, but when a data object is created an addtional property with the same name plus an idx suffix will be created, which will hold the index of the selected enum option. You can use the index property to sort by the enum value or when your enum options represent a sequence of values.

status: [unpaid, partial, paid, overdue]

type: [sales, purchase]

Elastic Search Indexing
currency customerId dueDate invoiceNumber issueDate status supplierId totalAmount type businessId

Properties that are indexed in Elastic Search will be searchable via the Elastic Search API. While all properties are stored in the elastic search index of the data object, only those marked for Elastic Search indexing will be available for search queries.

Database Indexing
currency customerId dueDate invoiceNumber issueDate status supplierId type businessId

Properties that are indexed in the database will be optimized for query performance, allowing for faster data retrieval. Make a property indexed in the database if you want to use it frequently in query filters or sorting.

Secondary Key Properties
invoiceNumber businessId

Secondary key properties are used to create an additional indexed identifiers for the data object, allowing for alternative access patterns. Different than normal indexed properties, secondary keys will act as primary keys and Mindbricks will provide automatic secondary key db utility functions to access the data object by the secondary key.

Relation Properties
customerId supplierId

Mindbricks supports relations between data objects, allowing you to define how objects are linked together. You can define relations in the data object properties, which will be used to create foreign key constraints in the database. For complex joins operations, Mindbricks supportsa BFF pattern, where you can view dynamic and static views based on Elastic Search Indexes. Use db level relations for simple one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, and use BFF views for complex joins that require multiple data objects to be joined together.

customerId: ID Relation to customer.id
The target object is a parent object, meaning that the relation is a one-to-many relationship from target to this object.

On Delete: Set Null Required: No

supplierId: ID Relation to supplier.id
The target object is a parent object, meaning that the relation is a one-to-many relationship from target to this object.

On Delete: Set Null Required: No

Formula Properties
totalAmount

Formula properties are used to define calculated fields that derive their values from other properties or external data. These properties are automatically calculated based on the defined formula and can be used for dynamic data retrieval.

totalAmount: Double
Formula: LIB.calculateInvoiceTotal(this)

Calculate After Instance: Yes

Calculate When Input Has: [id]

Filter Properties
customerId dueDate invoiceNumber issueDate status supplierId type businessId

Filter properties are used to define parameters that can be used in query filters, allowing for dynamic data retrieval based on user input or predefined criteria. These properties are automatically mapped as API parameters in the listing API's that have "Auto Params" enabled.

customerId: ID has a filter named customerId

dueDate: Date has a filter named dueDate

invoiceNumber: String has a filter named invoiceNumber

issueDate: Date has a filter named issueDate

status: Enum has a filter named status

supplierId: ID has a filter named supplierId

type: Enum has a filter named type

businessId: ID has a filter named businessId

invoiceItem Data Object
Object Overview
Description: Represents a single line item in an invoice, with product/service linkage, quantity, pricing, VAT, and per-line total.

This object represents a core data structure within the service and acts as the blueprint for database interaction, API generation, and business logic enforcement. It is defined using the ObjectSettings pattern, which governs its behavior, access control, caching strategy, and integration points with other systems such as Stripe and Redis.

Core Configuration
Soft Delete: Enabled — Determines whether records are marked inactive (isActive = false) instead of being physically deleted.
Public Access: accessPrivate — If enabled, anonymous users may access this object’s data depending on API-level rules.
